        the Borderland State Park trails in Easton in October 2013.  We stopped by a small waterfall 
        created by a dam for the pond for a rest and a drink from our water bottles, before continuing

    <string name="caption_land">The West Family (Rich, Karen, Peter and Sophie) climbed to the 
        top of the tower at Warwick Castle, England, in July 2013, not far from where Rich
        grew up in Derby,England.  Warwick Castle was built in wood in 1068, but transformed into
        stone in 1215.  There were no elevators or air conditioners back then, so the West Family were
        very hot and sticky when they reached the top of Warwick Castle this summer!</string>
